# Pan-Cancer-Detection-Using-Genome-Expression
Machine learning has enabled us to predict cancer precisely using transcriptome profiling data. Instead of relying solely on imaging and human expertise, our model can help physicians detect cancer at a much earlier stage and thus greatly improve the potential of patient treatment
